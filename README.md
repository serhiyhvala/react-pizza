# üçï React Pizza v2 üçï

This repository details the topic of creating a front-end part of a pizzeria online store using all of the technologies listed below.
Here is a collection of all the **top** and **relevant** frontend + React topics for 2022, which will be useful for **employment** or custom application development.
This project is ideal for both novice developers (junior) and pre-middle / middle.

# üî• What have I learned?

- Develop a full-fledged front-end application on ReactJS.
- Create components, pages, sorting, searching, pagination, filtering, popup windows, etc.
- Interact with the server part, send requests to the backend.
- Develop page navigation without reloading.
- Create a global data store for the entire application.
- Write strongly typed code in TypeScript.
- Work with LocalStorage to store site settings.
- Lazy Loading (lazy loading) + debounce (optimization for finding pizzas).
- Optimize component redraws/renders, code splitting (separating code into separate JS files), what is tree shaking and how to reduce component imports.
- Make adaptive layout.
- etc.

# üõ† Technologies:

- **ReactJS 18**
- **Redux Toolkit** (data/pizza storage)
- **React Router v6** (navigation)
- **Axios + Fetch** (send request to backend)
- React Hooks (hooks)
- Prettier (code formatting)
- CSS-Modules / SCSS (stylization)
- React Content Loader (skeleton)
- React Pagination (pagination)
- Lodash.Debounce
- Code Splitting, React Loadable, useWhyDidYouUpdate

### üöÄ Learn more about technologies

- **[Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)** - using this library, we will be able to create a global data store for our application, thus, a more convenient way to exchange information between different components our application. This library is being actively implemented in all large and small react projects for 2021-2022.
- **[React Router v6](https://reactrouter.com/docs/en/v6/getting-started/overview)** - will allow us to create navigation through our site without page reloads. You probably noticed that the VK or Instagram site, when you navigate through different sections, does not reload the entire page, but only a certain part of the site. It is this feature that we will implement in our application using React Router.
- **[Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios)** - will help us interact with the server side. Send data to the server or receive it, if necessary, from the server already in our front-end application.
- **[React Hooks](https://ru.reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)** is a set of ready-made functions inside the React library for solving various tasks, for example, storing data, determining the first display of the application , function optimizations, etc.
- **[Prettier](https://prettier.io/)** - our code should not only be well-written, but also **beautiful**. With Prettier, our code will automatically align inside our code editor, making it more readable.
- **[SCSS](https://sass-scss.ru/)** is the same CSS, but with more powerful features, functions, variables, loops (yes, Carl, loops in CSS) and a bunch of other cool solutions.
- **[CSS-Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules)** - we will use SCSS along with CSS modules. In fact, you don't have to learn anything new. You will write the same styles, but in separate files (css modules), thereby encapsulating your CSS classes.
- [**Lodash**](https://lodash.com/docs) - a set of ready-made JS functions for a huge number of different tasks.
